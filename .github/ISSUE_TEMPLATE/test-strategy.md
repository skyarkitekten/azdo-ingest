# Test Strategy: [Feature Name]

## Test Strategy Overview

[Summary of testing approach based on ISTQB and ISO 25010]

## ISTQB Framework Application

**Test Design Techniques Used:**

- [ ] Equivalence Partitioning
- [ ] Boundary Value Analysis
- [ ] Decision Table Testing
- [ ] State Transition Testing
- [ ] Experience-Based Testing

**Test Types Coverage:**

- [ ] Functional Testing
- [ ] Non-Functional Testing
- [ ] Structural Testing
- [ ] Change-Related Testing (Regression)

## ISO 25010 Quality Characteristics

**Priority Assessment:**

- [ ] Functional Suitability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Performance Efficiency: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Compatibility: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Usability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Reliability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Security: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Maintainability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- [ ] Portability: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## Quality Gates

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] Entry criteria defined
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Resources allocated

**Exit Criteria:**

- [ ] Exit criteria established
- [ ] Quality thresholds documented
- [ ] Success metrics defined

**Quality Thresholds:**

- [ ] Code coverage > 85%
- [ ] Test pass rate > 95%
- [ ] Zero critical defects
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| [Risk 1] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation approach] |
| [Risk 2] | [High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigation approach] |

## Test Environment Requirements

**Environment Setup:**

- [ ] Test environment configuration defined
- [ ] Test data requirements identified
- [ ] Tool dependencies documented
- [ ] Access and permissions configured

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test strategy reviewed and approved
- [ ] Quality gates defined and documented
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies established
- [ ] Team trained on testing approach

## Estimate

**Strategic planning effort**: 2-3 story points

## Dependencies

- [ ] [Dependency 1]
- [ ] [Dependency 2]
