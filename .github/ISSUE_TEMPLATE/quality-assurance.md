# Quality Assurance: [Feature Name]

## Quality Validation Scope

[Overall quality validation for feature/epic]

## ISO 25010 Quality Assessment

**Quality Characteristics Validation:**

- [ ] **Functional Suitability**: Completeness, correctness, appropriateness
- [ ] **Performance Efficiency**: Time behavior, resource utilization, capacity
- [ ] **Usability**: Interface aesthetics, accessibility, learnability, operability
- [ ] **Security**: Confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization
- [ ] **Reliability**: Fault tolerance, recovery, availability
- [ ] **Compatibility**: Browser, device, integration compatibility
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Code quality, modularity, testability
- [ ] **Portability**: Environment adaptability, installation procedures

## Quality Gates Validation

**Entry Criteria:**

- [ ] All implementation tasks completed
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Integration tests completed

**Exit Criteria:**

- [ ] All test types completed with >95% pass rate
- [ ] No critical/high severity defects
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security validation passed

## Quality Metrics

**Coverage Metrics:**

- [ ] Test coverage: [target]%
- [ ] Code coverage: >85%
- [ ] Branch coverage: >90% for critical paths
- [ ] Functional coverage: 100% acceptance criteria

**Defect Metrics:**

- [ ] Defect density: <[threshold] defects/KLOC
- [ ] Critical defects: 0
- [ ] High severity defects: <[threshold]
- [ ] Defect escape rate: <5%

**Performance Metrics:**

- [ ] Response time: <[threshold]ms
- [ ] Throughput: >[threshold] requests/second
- [ ] Resource utilization: <[threshold]%
- [ ] Memory leaks: None detected

**Security Metrics:**

- [ ] Vulnerability scan: Zero critical findings
- [ ] Security standards: Full compliance
- [ ] Authentication: All methods validated
- [ ] Authorization: Proper access controls

## Compliance Validation

**Accessibility Compliance:**

- [ ] WCAG {level} compliance validated
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility tested
- [ ] Keyboard navigation verified

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Category | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation Status |
|---------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| [Risk 1] | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigated/In Progress/Planned] |
| [Risk 2] | [Critical/High/Medium/Low] | [High/Medium/Low] | [Mitigated/In Progress/Planned] |
